title: Hello!

My name is [A. J. Wright](http://ajw.io).

I work as an [IT Security Officer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chief_information_security_officer), which often draws from my experience as a software developer and system administrator.  

For fun, I teach [SCUBA diving](https://www.facebook.com/donsscubaminions) and I design/develop video games.

I live in [Knoxville, TN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee) at the moment with my wife and more cats than I'm comfortable admitting.
