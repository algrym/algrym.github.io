title: Hello!
---
My name is [A. J. Wright](http://ajw.io).

I work as a [Unix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix) and [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Linux) [System Administrator](https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=System_administrator), which often draws from my experience as a software developer and IT security analyst.  

Fortunately my favorite hobby is working with [enterprise IT hardware and software](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/wiki/introduction), especially where it can be [applied in the home.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_automation)

I live in [Knoxville, TN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knoxville,_Tennessee) with my wife and more cats than I'm comfortable admitting.
