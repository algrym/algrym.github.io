I admit.  I'm an Internet technology addict.

I've got more half-completed websites and blogs out there than I can shake a stick at. (I'm from The South, so we shake sticks at all kinds of
things.)

Why? I enjoy setting up web applications and configuring them far more than I enjoy actually working with them.

Right now, I'm trying to figure out how Jekyll works based on [this tutorial.](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/usage/jekyll-quick-start.html)
